          <p>
            I started front-end development education in 2017. At first, I was
            fond of graphic design and Photoshop, however, after reading
            Artemy Lebedev’s book “Covodstvo”, I became familiar with the
            concepts of web-development and web-design. At that time, for me,
            the differences in professions seemed imperceptible. I like the
            idea itself and the ability to make web more beautiful and more
            convenient. And I began my learning path.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, I opened <a href="http://htmlbook.ru/" target="_blank">htmlbook</a> and rewrote all the tags into
            paper
            notebook and just memorized them, but absolutely didn’t know what
            to do with them. After that I came across <a href="https://webref.ru/" target="_blank">webref</a> resource -
            it
            gave me basic concepts about web in general. At the same time I
            watched video tutorials on YouTube and was very inspired by Daniil
            Fimushkin (web-designer from Russia). Web-development then seemed
            like an easy and exiting journey and at that time I hadn’t heard
            of such sing as a front-end. I just studied what I like and
            followed the dream of making web more beautiful and more
            convenient from usability perspective.
          </p>

          <p>
            But once, my good friend told me about recruiting for “Front-end
            Development Training” at EPAM. I had all the chances to get there,
            except for knowledge of JavaScript, and I started to learn it in
            two month before the training started. Here I felt what really
            web-development is. Luckily, I found the famous resource for
            beginners <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru/">learn.javascript.ru</a>. Since I need to visualize the
            information, I began to learn using the same approach as I used
            before learning HTML/CSS - I took a notebook and wrote the code by
            hand and memorized the syntax.
          </p>
          <p>
            The basic knowledge of algorithms and OOP was also indicated in
            the requirements, but I didn’t have time to study these topics
            before the start of the course and I decided that it was better to
            direct my efforts to learning the language. But lack of basic
            knowledge of algorithms and OOP played a trick with me in scope of
            the training unfortunately. I got into training at EPAM and I had
            to study a huge amount of related topics and concepts that I had
            to know before enrolling to the training. To my regret, my
            knowledge at the end of the course was not enough for the position
            front-end developer.
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point, something happened to me called imposter syndrome.
            I wanted to give up everything and forget about the career of a
            programmer, but in July 2019, I found out about recruiting in
            RSSchool - and I again felt a
            desire to develop and realized that this was a great chance to
            close my knowledge gaps and structure it in my head. Also, my plan
            is to enroll to DesignSpot School as I’m fond of UI/UX design to
            wide skillset in scope of front-end development.

            I studied English only at school. Until the 6th grade, I studied
            English at a linguistics gymnasium in Vitebsk in a class with a
            focus on English. <br />In July 2019, I graduated from English
            courses with native speakers from America - Practically Speaking
            English by <a href="http://esl.by/" target="_blank">ESL.by</a>. In
            this course I determined the level of language - Intermediate.
            <br />The courses lasted 9 days, 2 hours per day.
